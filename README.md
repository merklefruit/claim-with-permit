# Claim with Permit â€¢ Digital signature scheme for allow-listed token claims

Working proof of concept for a digital signature scheme that allows a user to sign a claim with a permit. The permit is a signed message that allows the claim to be signed by the user. The permit is signed by a trusted party, and the claim is executed by the user. The claim is only valid if the permit is valid.
