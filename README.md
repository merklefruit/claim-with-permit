# Claim with Permit â€¢ Digital signature scheme for allow-listed token claims

Working proof of concept for a digital signature scheme that allows a user to only claim a token with a signed permission. The permit is a message signed by a verifier (a trusted party) that allows the claim to be executed by the user. The claim is only valid if the permit is valid.
